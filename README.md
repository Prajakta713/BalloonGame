# BalloonGame

## 📦 Installation

This game needs to be run on a local server to load assets correctly.

### 🖥 Run Locally with Live Server

1. Download or clone the project folder.
2. Make sure all assets (balloons, pump, string, letters) are in the correct folders.
3. Open the project in **VS Code** (or any code editor).
4. Right-click on `index.html` and choose **"Open with Live Server"** (requires the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)).

### 🔥 Don't have Live Server?

Install it for VS Code:

- Go to **Extensions** (Ctrl+Shift+X)
- Search for **Live Server**
- Click **Install**

Then follow step 4 above.

### 🌐 Alternative Options

You can also use any of the following:

- Run a basic HTTP server with Python:

  ```bash
  # Python 3
  python -m http.server
